Fiends And Fortune
==================
_Fiends And Fortune_ is a personal playground for turning old school paper and 
pencil role playing game rules into code.

I was an avid role player and game master in high school and college, spending 
hours with friends enjoying Dungeons & Dragons, Tunnels & Trolls, Traveller, 
RuneQuest and many others.  Aspects of these games screamed out to be automated, 
which I tried to do for various games at various times in numerous languages, 
including TRS-80 BASIC, Pascal, dBase, Excel macros, C++, Visual BASIC, Java, 
Python, Scala, Objective-C -- you get the picture.  I'm sure there's a 
half-finished project in a half-learned language I'm forgetting here.

The progression of half-baked attempts to encode various rule systems closely 
tracks my development as a programmer.  I find this type of project to be a
great way to really learn a new language or framework; the complexity and 
ambiguity inherent in game rules designed for humans is a good example of the 
types of real world problems you have to tackle as a programmer.  Unfortunately 
most of these RPG projects were abandoned part-way through.  They provided a 
good learning experience, then inevitably my interests moved on.

Though I still enjoy learning new languages, the C language has become and 
remained a favorite over the years.  In 2012 I decided to automate some of the 
old treasure generation tables from one of the old fantasy games I spent 
countless hours playing.  I've returned to this project periodically since 
then.

This code is old-school, command line oriented and text based.
